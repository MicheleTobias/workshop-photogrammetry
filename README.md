# workshop-photogrammetry
This is an introductory workshop on photogrammetry.

# Introduction

Photogrammetry is ??????????????????


The outline of the workshop could easily structure an entire book, so we won't go into significant depth in a 2-hour workshop. My goal is to help you understand the major parts of the air photo workflow and learn the terminology that will allow you to continue learning on your own.



# Step 1: What Question Do You Want to Answer?

Before you do anything else, you need to define your goals. What question do you want to answer? The goals you set for your line of questioning will form the foundation of every decision you need to make going forward. The importance of this step cannot be overstated.


 
# Step 2: Obtain Your Images
 
## Which Dataset?

Thinking about the question you want to answer, what properties should your photo dataset have?

Consider theses questions:

 * What geographic area do you want to investigate? 
 * What geographic scale do you need to work at? Are you interested in a global question, something hyper local like a beach, or something in between like a city or county?
 * How large are the objects or phenomena you want to detect? Are you identifying trees? Maybe small shrubs? Park benches?
 * What time scale are you working with? Do you just need one point in time? When is it? Do you want to understand this question over time? How often do you need images?
 * What wavelengths will help you detect these objects or phenomena? Studies of plants often require infrared, for example.
 
## Existing Datasets

Aerial photography collections

Satellite imagery

## Collect Your Own

Drone

Kite

Balloon

Contract with an Air Photo Company

Resources for data collection: Clancy & Michele's past workshops

# Step 3: Processing

You processing workflow should be tailored to your data needs.

Possible photo processing steps (in no particular order):

 * Cropping/Masking - reduce the size of your data by removing areas that aren't needed for the analysis
 * Stitching/Mosaicing - combine photos to make one continuous, larger dataset


# Step 4: Interpretation

There are entire courses in how to do this step, and your process will depend on your question. 

How do you know how to do this process?
 * Take an introductory course
 * Textbooks
 * Explore the academic literature for methods about air photo interpretation for your (and possibly related) systems
